        My love for video games began very early,
        even before I could afford any console or pc.
        Nintendo and Playstation played a role
        in my passion for video games as they were
        the first consoles I ever owned.
        Well, not owned because we didn't have
        any money for video games or any console
        for that matter. What I have had was the chance
        to borrow consoles and games from friends who
        were fortunate enough to buy them.
        <br><br>
        I still remember Power Rangers, Mario,
        Ratchet and Clank, Resident Evil, and so on
        from hours of playing these games. One game
        stood out for me, God of War and yes, I know...
        I was too young for such a game but I played it anyway.
        <br><br>
        It all changed a bit during adolescence because
        during this time of my life, I moved from Brazil
        to Germany.

        Upon arriving in Germany with my mother and sorting out
        our lives, eventually, I owned a PC and Playstation. Then 
        my passion for gaming continued, but this time I wanted to do
        more than just play games.
        <br><br>
        Throughout my adolescence and highschool period, I had begun to
        modify games, for example like changing car models, character skins,
        creating new textures for the assets, and so on. It was all fascinating, 
        but after finishing highschool, I sadly made the wrong choice of finding
        full-time jobs instead of going to college to continue and further
        improve my education.
        <br><br>
        After four and a half years of working full-time, I had reached my lowest.
        A very depressing time in my life, full of unhappiness and this
        is what pushed me into quitting my job to go back to college at 24 years
        old and thankfully this is a very normal thing for young adults to do
        in Germany which gave me comfort in knowing I wouldn't be alone or
        wasting my time.

        As a student, I now focus on my passion that I sadly
        had putten away due to work and started learning game development
        after college hours. Anytime I'm free, I invest time into learning.
        <br><br>
        My first game project was a flappy bird type of game called "Grumpy"
        inspired by youtube tutorials. The goal of "Grumpy" was to get familiar with a
        game engine such as Unity. My second game "Savior" was a survival game,
        to teach me how to program a simple AI, character controller 
        , and a little bit of character art. Then I moved on to a more complex
        project "Fatebringer" based on a shooter game that I still play to this day.
        It taught me to program more complex aspects of 2D game design.
        <br><br>
        After finishing three games in 2D, I then decided to move on to 3D projects, 
        thus creating my very first 3D game. Another challenge to overcome and after
        six months of learning and developing, I created and published my fourth
        game called "Zeo".
        <br><br>
        These four games were all done and published within one year of learning
        game development, and now I can create my own assets, program whatever
        is needed for my games, and all of it was achieved by loving what I do.
        <br><br>
        Passion and dedication are two very powerful things.
        My goal is to become a professional game developer.
